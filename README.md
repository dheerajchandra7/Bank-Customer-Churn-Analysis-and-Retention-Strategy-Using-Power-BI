📝 Executive Summary (One-Page)

This Power BI project delivers a comprehensive churn analysis for a retail bank. With a churn rate of 20.37%, the bank faces significant customer loss, especially among customers in Germany, females, middle-aged groups, inactive members, and single-product users. Financial and behavioral patterns strongly influence churn, such as lower balance, mid-income salary groups, and poor credit scores.

The dashboard offers a 360° view of customer behavior, helping stakeholders identify high-risk segments and implement targeted retention strategies. Recommendations include region-specific interventions, engagement programs, mid-life financial solutions, and cross-selling strategies. This analysis equips the bank with actionable insights to reduce churn and strengthen long-term customer relationships.
